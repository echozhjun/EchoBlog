## Sherwood Anderson on Art and Life: A Letter of Advice to His Teenage Son, 1927[^1]

In 1926, Sherwood wrote to his 17 year old son a beautifully written letter which encapsulated insights on life, art and not deceived by stupid men or money:

> Next to occupation is the building of good taste. That is difficult, slow work.
> Few achieve it.
> It means all the difference in the world in the end.
>
> I am constantly amazed at how little painters know about painting, writers about writing, merchants about business, manufacturers about manufacturing.
> Most men just drift.

And in the next year, Sherwood sent his son another letter of advice on art, and the process to be an artist:

> Try to be humbles. Smartness kills everything.
>
> The object of art is not to make salable pictures. It is to save yourself.
> 艺术的目的不是制作畅销的图片，而是为了拯救你自己。
>
> Any cleanness I have in my own life is due to my feeling for words.
>
> There is no special trick about writing or painting either. I wrote constantly for 15 years before I produced anything with any solidity to it.
>
> The point of being an artist is that you may live.
>
> You won't arrive. It is an endless search.
