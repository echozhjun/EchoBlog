若不是昨天被同学提醒，我都不会注意到今天是七夕<br/>  不过对于爱情，我想我还是一无所知<br/>  或许大多数人也都跟我一样，无法用理智去解读爱情<br/>  还好，艺术家为我们打开了另一扇窗<br/>  又有什么能像一首动人的诗或歌那样，告诉我们爱情的含义呢?  

So, let's be moved.

##Right atrium :

**Sky Song** by *Robert Desnos*

> The flower of the Alps told the seashell:"You're shining"   
> The seashell told the sea:"You echo"  
> The sea told the boat:"You're shuddering"   
> The boat told the fire:"You're glowing brightly"   
> The fire told me:"I glow less brightly than her eyes"   
> The boat told me: "I shudder less than your heart does when she appears"   
> The sea told me:"I echo less than her name does in your love-making"   
> The seashell told me:"I shine less brightly than the phosphorus of desire in 
> your hollow dream"   
> The flower of the Alps told me:"She's beautiful"    
> I said:"She's beautiful, so beautiful, she moves me."
