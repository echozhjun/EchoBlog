This is a project by Yang Zetian, now a undergraduate in BUAA, Beijing, China.

Since the second half year 2011, I work in the jliulab in BNU. 
That give me a chance to use Linux substantially, and I'm more and more interested to it.
As a Linux beginner, I have been met with a lot of problems while working with it.
Some of them I solved and got a lot of fun, but some of them I didn't.
As my memory is not very good, I start to think of making records of these problems so that I needn't begin from scratch when coming across them again.
Incidentally, I got to know that Github can be used as a free blog server. 
That's what I need exactly, so everything begins...
