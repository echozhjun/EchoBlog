This is a blog by Zetian Yang, a senior undergraduate in [BUAA][buaa], Beijing, China.

Since the second half year 2011, I have been working in the [jliulab][liujia] in BNU.
That give me a chance to use linux substantially, and I'm more and more interested to it. 
As a linux beginner, I have been confronted with a lot of problems while working with it. 
Some of these problems I solved and got a lot of fun, but some of them I didn't. 

As my memory isn't very good, I start thinking of making records of these problems so that I needn't begin from scratch when coming across them again. 
Besides, I had been longing for a blog to write my minds down.
Incidentally, I got to know that [Github][] can be used as a free blog server. 
That's exactly what I need, so everything begins.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll][], and uses [Pandoc][] as the markdown renderer.
The theme is based on ["the-minimum"][] by [Yuya Saito][], which I make a bunch of modifications on.
All the source code of this site is availabe at my blog [repo][r1], and if you wanna use [Pandoc][] to be the renderer as well, my fork of [Jekyll][r2] may help.

作为介绍，上面的内容可能已经很长，所以中文部分我就不罗嗦了。

我叫杨泽天，现在还是[帝都仰望星空夜校][buaa]的一名学生。毕业后将去北师大小红楼给[刘老板][liujia]干活，专业是认知神经科学。

我的专业兴趣包括：

* 认知科学, 神经科学
* 概率，统计，机器学习，计算机视觉
* 心理学

除了干和以上学科相关的活，我剩下的自由时间就很少了，大多花在睡觉上，偶尔做做以下事情:

* 阅读。喜欢的作家有：织田作之助，阿瑟·米勒，芥川龙之介，麦克尤恩，王小波，乔治·奥威尔，理查德·耶茨，雷蒙德·卡佛，加缪，凯鲁亚克，郁达夫，卡夫卡。
* 游泳。目前只会蛙泳，因此每次被自由泳选手超过时心里总是恨恨的，如果你慷慨大方且离我比较近，那可以来教我自由泳，我将努力做个优秀的学生。
